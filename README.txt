Hi readers!

This time all of my code is contained in the Jupiter notebook. I wrote detailed steps in the notebook that will walk you through my code, with sufficient visualization of the images. 

All you need to do is to run the Jupiter notebook file called main.ipynb.

The demo folder contains images used in the jupyter notebook demo
